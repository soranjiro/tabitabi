# Development

You must follow and read all of the development rules in `docs/developer/*.md` and `docs/*`.

When testing or checking ui, use playwright and demo data.

## Mind these key points
- light web site
- update readability
- Do not write comments, you can write English comments if you should

## Commit message
- use conventional commit message
  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <subject>
  ```
